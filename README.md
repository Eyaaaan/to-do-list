Welcome to my To-Do List project repository! 📝✅

This is a small personal project that I built to dive into the world of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through this project, I've explored various functionalities and techniques, honing my skills to further improve and understand the fundamentals of front-end web development.

Feel free to explore the code and utilize this project as a learning resourse for your own web development journey!
